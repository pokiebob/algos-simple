/**
 * TIC-TAC-TOE - MINIMAX
 * 
 *      "The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical,
 *      or diagonal row is the winner. It is a solved game with a forced draw assuming best
 *      play from both players.
 * 
 *      The game can be generalized to an m,n,k-game in which two players alternate placing
 *      stones of their own color on an mÃ—n board, with the goal of getting k of their own
 *      color in a row. Tic-tac-toe is the (3,3,3)-game.[3] 
 * 
 *      Harary's generalized tic-tac-toe is an even broader generalization of tic-tac-toe.
 *      It can also be generalized as a nd game. Tic-tac-toe is the game where n equals 3
 *      and d equals 2.[4] It can be generalised even further by playing on an arbitrary
 *      incidence structure, where rows are lines and cells are points."
 *                                                                              - Wikipedia
