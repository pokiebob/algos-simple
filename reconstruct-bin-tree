/**
 * RECONSTRUCT BIN TREE
 * Order of traversal
 * Remember Pre, In, and Post with respect to to A, the ROOT node.
 *      A          Pre  : ABC         ROOT Left Right. This is a depth-first-traversal
 *    /    \       In   : BAC         Left ROOT Right
 *  B      C       Post : BCA         Left Right ROOT
 *
 * For implementation, we can count how many times visited:
 *                                       Print when:
 *            A       Pre  : ABDGHEICFJ  1st time/leaf (Depth-first-traversal)
 *         /    \     In   : GDHBIEACJF  2nd time/leaf
 *        B      C    Post : GHDIEBJFCA  3rd time/leaf
 *      /   \      \  
 *     D     E      F
 *    / \   /      / 
 *   G  H  I      J
*  
* CHALLENGE
* Given the sequence of keys visited by a postorder traversal of a binary
* search tree, reconstruct the tree.
* For example, given the sequence 2, 4, 3, 8, 7, 5, you should construct
* the following tree:
* 
*     5
*    / \
*   3   7
*  / \   \
* 2   4   8
